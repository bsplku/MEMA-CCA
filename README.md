# Mixed-effects multilevel analysis (MEMA) & Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) in fMRI study
* Guide for MEMA followed by CCA in leave-one-subject-out cross validation

## Sample data : 
* The samples of pre-preocessed fMRI BOLD timeseries were acquired while the subjects were smoking with two types of the MR-competible e-cigarette apparatus (i.e., ECIG; with nicotine, SCIG; without nicotine) in MRI scanner and scored two behavioral measurements (similarity to their own e-cigarette in terms of nicotine absorption and the level of urge-to-smoke) 
* Our dataset consists of 10 subjects, each subject smoked both e-cigarettes in turns (4 blocks per run)
